My version of a Connect 4/Four in a Row as a web browser game.

## Summary:

### This is a simple reimagination of the popular game "Connect 4" (also called Four in a Line)

## User should be able to:

- be presented with a prompt on window load
- user clicks start and selects the color
- red always goes first
- select which column to place their token in and see it fall to the lowest available space
- stack tokens on top of one another
- be presented with the updated game state after each move
- game ends when one player connects 4 pieces in one line, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, or all spaces are filled with no connections made
